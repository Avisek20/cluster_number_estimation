* The **generate_.py** files are used to generate the experiment data.

* **cluster_kmeans.py** clusters all the generated data.

* **experiment_indices_km.py** estimates the number of clusters across several different cluster number estimation methods and indices.

* **count_results.py** and **results_analysis.py** help analyze the obtained results.

* The **indices** directory contains implementations of several popular cluster number estimation methods and indices.
